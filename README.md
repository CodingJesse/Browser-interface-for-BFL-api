### Prerequisites 

Ensure you have the following software installed:
 
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)  (version 14 or higher)

- A Flux API key (available at [https://api.bfl.ml/](https://api.bfl.ml/))

### Installation 

Follow the steps below to install the application:
 
1. **Clone the Repository** 
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
cd flux-api-interface
```
 
2. **Install Dependencies** 
Install the required npm packages:


```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration 
 
1. **Edit the `.env` File** In the root of the project, and replace `your_flux_api_key` with your actual Flux API key.

```env
API_KEY=your_flux_api_key
```
 
2. **Verify Configuration** Ensure all variables are correctly set. You can adjust the `PORT` variable if you wish to run the server on a different port.

### Starting the Server 

Start the application with the following command:


```bash
npm start
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the following message:


```arduino
Server is running on http://localhost:3000
```

### Usage 
 
1. **Open the Interface** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to use the application.
 
2. **View Results** 
  - While the image is being generated, you will see a status message.

  - Once the image is ready, it will be displayed on the page.

  - Click on the image to view it in a larger window.
 
  - The generated image is automatically saved in the `public/images` folder.
